The poster is the collage of the twitter users and followers.

<h3>Keep yourself updated - The Twitter Magic</h3>
Next came the Twitter, Pownce kind of services which made the information live to the users. You get the information on your desktop or mobile whenever they are generated. Do you know, In <strong>MacWorld Expo</strong> while <a href="http://mashable.com/2008/01/15/macworld-twitter-crash/">Steve Jobs delivering his Keynote the Twitter has crashed!</a> This is the influence of Twitter.

About above stuffs are termed as TumbleLogs. TumbleLogs? Yeah small brother of Weblog or Blog!!! Even I've <a href="http://maheshexp.tumblr.com/">my tumble log</a> in <a href="http://tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> to record small information, events, photos instantly.

But <a href="http://twitter.com/maheshexp" target="_blank">Twitter</a> goes one step a head and make you the information available right from it's generation.

Twitter pushing you the information to your desktop ( through GTalk )

<a href="http://pownce.com/maheshexp">Pownce</a> is another push message service, which offers more than Twitter and slowly grabbing the market share of <a title="Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/maheshexp">Twitter</a>.
<h3>'Face'Book is Index of your <strong>Friend's </strong>Mind</h3>
If you are a facebook or orkut user , you could very well see the updates on your home page of the profile. Those updates are about your friends and contacts , those who have changed, modified, added something in their profile.

Facebook makes things very open, it will update you each and every activity of what your contacts / friends does. Facebook updating your friends activities on your home page.

Orkut keeping you posted on your friends update.

Now, you would feel and even nod with me that this Era is making you Lazy , more, more and more..but powerful..more, more and more

But of course this is one of the major advantage of this Era, where information chases us.

Though Orkut and Facebook are connecting people, LinkedIn and Plaxo are helping you to keep updated with your friends, contacts, your business network and server you more. There was post from Amit on <a href="http://www.labnol.org/software/download/check-flickr-twitter-facebook-automatically-with-8hands/2125/">how to manage various social profile through one service - 8hands</a>.
