Recently came across [jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and a related post by [Tom perston](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html), its creator. The idea of doing a geek blogging impressed me and I spent my entire Saturday spending time on reading and exploring about it. Since I was already using Github , I didn't face difficulty in using it and also Git UI client like [SmartGit](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/index.html), makes Git usage easier, even for a geek.

I shall write a post in detail about how I explored, learnt and tested small test posts (*including this post*) in Github's Jekyll.
