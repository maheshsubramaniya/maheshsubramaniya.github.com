You are living a life in Internet and you are using a lots of web-application, services via Internet. But still there are much better services comming up and we tend to subscribe and start using it. But, are you ever read the Terms of Service ( shortly ToS ) of the service you are using it? <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/02/17/facebook-terms-of-service-poll/" target="_blank">Facebook has faced serious concerns</a> over it's change in ToS. Many of it's users are not happy with it's change in ToS. So the question is, why does a Infrequently read ToS bothers much? Whats in there in the ToS.

Ok. Lets begin with knowing about what is terms of service.
<h3>What is Terms of Service ( ToS )?</h3>
Terms of Service are the rules written by the Web-service providers ( eg: Google, Yahoo, Facebook ) to make the usage of the application in a reasonable way. Example, if you look at the point 8 in <a href="http://www.google.com/accounts/TOS?hl=en" target="_blank">Google Docs ToS</a> ,
<blockquote><em>8.3 <strong>Google reserves the right (but shall have no obligation) to pre-screen, review, flag, filter, modify, refuse or remove any or all Content from any Service. For some of the Services, Google may provide tools to filter out explicit sexual content</strong>. These tools include the SafeSearch preference settings (see http://www.google.com/help/customize.html#safe). In addition, there are commercially available services and software to limit access to material that you may find objectionable. </em></blockquote>
Now this restricts users who are about to upload the illegal / sexual contents. Now this forces the users to use the service in a resonable way.
<h3>Why the companies using it?</h3>
Companies are using ToS service for the following reasons
<h4>1. To provide reasonable service to it's customers.</h4>
Online services company runs web application for massive user base. The companies should provide reasonable amount of service to their users. They promise this in the ToS.
<h4>2. Proper utilization of service by users</h4>
Companies running those web application will be spending for Server, Bandwidth, and other computational and non-computational resources.So, the user should access those resources in a reasonable and optimal way.

<span style="color: #008000;">Eg: Google will not allow you to upload files of size more than 500 KB or Presentations upto 10 MB.</span>

So by enforcing this rule, the companies make sure that they are able to provide good service to everyone. Think, if the google allows to upload files of size 2 GB at a single shot, not all the users will have the same bandwith to upload the files, hence will convert into slow servers, unhappy customers, then loose business.
<h4>3. Protect themselves from legal issues</h4>
Companies will write up the ToS in such a way that they are most protected via the legal issues that might face from it's customers. Recently <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-17852_3-10258071-71.html" target="_blank">Twitter has been sued</a> due to it's fault on it's service ( but twitter has responded back  accordingly )
<h3>How to keep track of the Terms of service?</h3>
So, if you have ever seen a ToS page of any service it runs for miles and sure anyone wouldn't have  enough patience to read/glance it even. A online service <a href="http://www.tosback.org/timeline.php" target="_blank">TOSBack tracks about 42 companies</a> ToS and it's changes. You can check what does a company tells in it's ToS and what it has changed recently. Based on this you can use the service accordingly.
