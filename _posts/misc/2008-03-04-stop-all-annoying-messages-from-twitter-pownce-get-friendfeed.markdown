Yeah really, this would save you a lot of annoying pings, emails and messages. You can now turnoff your notification in Digg, Pownce and twitter and still get updated through the Rendered.

Once you have created your feeds, <a href="http://friendfeed.com/maheshexp">FriendFeed</a> combines everything into a RSS feed send a one time email notification either daily / weekly.
