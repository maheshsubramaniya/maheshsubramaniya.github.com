title: Yahoo Answers!!! â€“ Yet another Sucess story from Yahoo
categories: ['misc']
---
Yahoo made the biggie and it's rival Google to close down one of it's services, Google Answers and fall to it's feet. Yahoo introduced <a target="_blank" href="http://answers.yahoo.com" title="Yahoo! Answers">Yahoo! Answers</a> and made it rocked by making it free, where google charged few pennies to answer the questions.

That was one of the major move by Yahoo and now Yahoo rocks in the service. There is quite a pile of question in every topic from silly to macro thoughts. One should really make of this service, as lot of experts answers the question in the field you ask your question.

Now I made it as a daily habbit to visit the site and learn new things. This really a good place to know new things and clarify our own doubts too.
