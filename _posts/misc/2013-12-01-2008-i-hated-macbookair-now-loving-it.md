[Back in 2008](/article/why-you-wont-love-macbook-air.html) I hated it so much and so sarcastic on it. The basic version had only 80 GB harddisk and it was a complete strip down version of then fully loaded laptop (with DVD drives, 4 gig RAM, fast processor, wide screen etc.,). That was the time when the world was ruled by HP, Dell and Lenovo laptops.

Now fast forward to 2013 and well I'm owning a [Macbook Air 13" with 8GB RAM and i7 processor](http://anandtech.com/show/7085/the-2013-macbook-air-review-13inch/3). Which is way superior than any Notebook today in market. I bought the new Macbook Air from Adorama on <time>Sep 2013</time> and now it is <time>Dec 2013</time> for the past 4 months, I have pushed my notebook to some exteme level  ([ofcourse not like this](http://cnettv.cnet.com/new-macbook-air-torture-test-always/9742-1_53-50128386.html)) of processing and it has survived well and I'm impressed.

In today's world neither I do not miss Optical Drives because I handle files or documents through flash drives, online or in worst case I can buy a External USB optical drive for $20+ nor I'm not worried about sealed batteries anymore. But may be about ethernet port ( [apple has an adapter now](http://store.apple.com/us/product/MD463ZM/A/thunderbolt-to-gigabit-ethernet-adapter) ) if I'm at India as you Wifi is just improving for better up in our homes. And definately more on 1 USB port 3.0 is good, along with Intel's Thunderbolt technology, impressive again.
