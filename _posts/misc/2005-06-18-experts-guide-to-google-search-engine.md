Today i had found this link, which exposes the various services provided by google search engine...note it, through search engines. it gives a list of commands to be used for quicker search.

Eg:

<b>cache:</b>  Display Google's cached version of a web page.

<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:www.googleguide.com" target="_blank">cache:www.googleguide.com</a>(Show Google's cached version of <a href="http://www.googleguide.com/"> Google Guide</a>'s home page.)

<b>info: (or id:)</b>  Find info about a page.   <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=info:www.googleguide.com" target="_blank">info:www.googleguide.com</a>
(Find information about the <a href="http://www.googleguide.com/">Google Guide</a> website.)

<b>related:</b>   List web pages that are similar or related to the URL.   <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=related:www.googleguide.com" target="_blank">related:www.googleguide.com </a> (Find websites related to the <a href="http://www.googleguide.com/">Google Guide</a> website.) RESTRICT SEARCH TO SITES WHERE QUERY WORDS APPEAR

<b>allinanchor:</b>   All query words must appear in anchor text of links to the page.   <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=allinanchor:+S-and-S+Coupling" target="_blank"> allinanchor: S-and-S Coupling</a> (Search for pages in which the anchor text contains "S-and-S coupling".)

<b>inanchor:</b>   Terms must appear in anchor text of links to the page.

<b>restaurants inanchor:gourmet</b> (Search for pages on restaurants for which links to the page mention the word "gourmet".)
