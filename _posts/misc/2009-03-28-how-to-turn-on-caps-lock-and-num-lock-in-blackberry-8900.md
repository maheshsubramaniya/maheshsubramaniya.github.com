CAPS lock and NUM lock are cool features in <a href="http://www.maheshsubramaniya.com/tag/blackberry">Blackberry</a>, which was not known by Â many Blackberry users that they exists or how to activate it. And I was also one of those poor user ;-). I was not using this feature to its full extend until a necessity arisen for me.

<strong>Turn on CAPS Lock</strong> : Press <strong>ALT</strong> Key + <strong>RIGHT SHIFT </strong>Key

<strong>Turn on NUM Lock</strong> : Press <strong>ALT</strong> Key + <strong>LEFT SHIFT </strong>Key
