<p style="text-align: center;">Firefox 3.5 beta has improved a lots features and added few stuffs too. One of the thing which impressed me is the "Restore Session". In the older firefox, once you session crashes, and you re-launch the firefox, it will popup this.
<a href="../images/2009/06/firefox-restore-session.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-768" title="firefox-restore-session" src="../images/2009/06/firefox-restore-session-300x112.png" alt="firefox-restore-session" width="300" height="112" /></a>

And it will open up all the browser tabs in your previous session, which is very annoying sometimes.

Now the revamp in Firefox 3.5 beta has made an improvement in the Restore session. Now it got smarter and lists down all the websites that you were browsing in your previous session. And you can deselect the website that you dont want to launch in the current session.

This improvement will actually help you to get rid of the site which caused you the crash previously.
