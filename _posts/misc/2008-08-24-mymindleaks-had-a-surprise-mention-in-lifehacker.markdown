One fine morning, my recent blog item <a href="http://www.maheshsubramaniya.com/google/unclutter-your-google-reader/">Unclutter Google reader</a>, had saw a spike in hits.When I was analyzing the causes, I came across various pingbacks and surprisingly once of them was from Lifehacker. I was just exited to see what it was. I'm very pleased to see that <a href="http://adampash.com/">Adam Pash</a>, <a title="Adam Pash Lifehacker" href="http://lifehacker.com/people/adam.pash">Senior Editor of Lifehacker</a> mentioned about my post. And it was more exiting for me when I came to know that Adam Pash found my post via <a href="http://www.micropersuasion.com/">Steve Rubel's twitter of MicroPesuation</a>.

Thanks a ton Adam, for mentioning <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5040090/unclutter-google-reader-by-analyzing-your-trends">my post in Lifehacker</a>.
