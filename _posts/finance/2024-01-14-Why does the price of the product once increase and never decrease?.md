A product you bought ten years ago costs more today. We all know inflation causes price increases. 


> Why does drop in inflation not decrease the price?
> <br> Answer: **Inflation is compounding.**

Yes. If the price of a product is $100 and inflation is at 4% at the beginning of, say, 2020, this is how the price grows each year.

| End of Year | Rate | Price |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 2020 | ..% | $100 |
| 2021 | 5% | $105 |
| 2022 | 5% | $110.25 |
| 2023 | 4% | $114.66 |
| 2024 | 3% | $118.10 |
| 2025 | 2% | $120.5 |

So, as illustrated in the table, 2021 inflation increased to 5%; it stayed the same in 2022 and started to drop 1% every year, hitting the Fed's dream target of 2%. Now, the exact product would cost $120.50. 

Invest in assets that give you little over the inflation rate to maintain the same purchasing power. The more, the merrier, but you should aim to achieve a little over the inflation rate.

So, if anyone says inflation is dropping, keep in mind that the rate at which the price of a product grows is slower than before; it does not undo the growth.

### Can the price go down?

Yes.

Deflation is having a negative inflation rate. During the great depression, many countries faced this.
