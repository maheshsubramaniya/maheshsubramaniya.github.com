 US Government has 3 knobs. They can turn the knob anytime based on whatever the agenda it is. No, I am not talking about any conspiracy theory,  I am just talking about what happens when they are going to turn the knob. 

**Interest rates**: When interest rates rise, it can affect taxes in several ways. For example, it can increase the cost of borrowing, which can reduce consumer spending and business investment, and lower tax revenues. It can also increase the value of the US dollar, which can reduce exports and increase imports, and lower tax revenues. Conversely, when interest rates fall, it can stimulate borrowing and investment, which can boost consumer spending and business investment, and increase tax revenues. It can also weaken the US dollar, which can increase exports and reduce imports, and increase tax revenues.

**Money supply**: When money supply changes, it can affect taxes in several ways. For example, if the money supply increases, it can stimulate economic growth and inflation, which can increase tax revenues. However, it can also reduce the value of the US dollar, which can increase imports and reduce exports, and lower tax revenues. Conversely, if the money supply decreases, it can slow down economic growth and inflation, which can reduce tax revenues. However, it can also increase the value of the US dollar, which can reduce imports and increase exports, and increase tax revenues.

**Taxes**: Taxes are a major source of revenue for the US government, and they are used to fund various goods, programs, and services to support the American public and pay interest incurred from borrowing. Taxes are levied on income, payroll, property, sales, capital gains, dividends, imports, estates and gifts, as well as various fees. [In 2020, taxes collected by federal, state, and local governments amounted to 25.5% of GDP, below the OECD average of 33.5% of GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_the_United_States) [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_the_United_States).

The US government has several tools at its disposal to control the economy and the market. These include fiscal policy, monetary policy, and regulatory policy.

There is another type of Tax. <h3>It is called Inflation.</h3>
[Sometime called as "hidden tax"](https://taxfoundation.org/blog/inflation-tax/). Inflation is sometimes referred to as a “hidden tax” because it reduces the purchasing power of money and increases the cost of goods and services, which can have similar effects to a tax. Inflation can also push taxpayers into higher income tax brackets or reduce the value of tax credits, deductions, and exemptions, which can increase their tax liability without an increase in real income. This phenomenon is known as bracket creep, and it can have a significant impact on taxpayers, especially those with fixed incomes or savings. However, in a traditional sense,  it is not levied by the government and does not generate revenue for the government. 

But, But, based on the "Interest Rate" know, government can make or break Inflation. Like what happened since 2020 pandemic in USA.
