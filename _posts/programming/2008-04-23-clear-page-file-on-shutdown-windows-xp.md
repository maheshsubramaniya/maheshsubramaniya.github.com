When people have RAM size of 512 MB or 1 GB , Page file setup would increase your performance . But these page file is always stored on your system and while your windows starts, Windows will clear up the old page file , it's memory and starts creating new page file. This would take a while during your system setup. </p><p>But you can clear your page file while your Windows Shutdown, WINXPCPS.REG, an utility which clears the page file during the Windows XP Shutdown. This Registration (.REG) file clears the Page file when you power off the computer.</p>
