<ul><font face="Times New Roman">
	<li>Create a blank text file with .LOG as the first line of the file, followed by a carriage return.</li>
	<li>Double-click the file to open it and notice that Notepad appends the current date and time to the end of the file and places the cursor on the line after.</li>
	<li>Type your notes and then save and close the file.</li>
</font></ul>
<font face="Times New Roman">Each time you open the file, Notepad repeats the process, appending the time and date to the end of the file and placing the cursor below it .</font>
