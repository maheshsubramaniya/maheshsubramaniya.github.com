KML is originally created in the Google labs for rendering the Google Earth and Google Maps application is now been apporoved as International Standards for developing the Geospatial application. <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/">Open Geospatial Consortium ( OGC )</a> will now take control over the KML standards.
<h3>How a KML structure will look like?</h3>
<pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;kml xmlns="http://earth.google.com/kml/2.2"&gt;
&lt;Placemark&gt;
&lt;name&gt;Simple placemark&lt;/name&gt;
&lt;description&gt;Attached to the ground. Intelligently places itself
at the height of the underlying terrain.&lt;/description&gt;
&lt;Point&gt;
&lt;coordinates&gt;-122.0822035425683,37.42228990140251,0&lt;/coordinates&gt;
&lt;/Point&gt;
&lt;/Placemark&gt;
&lt;/kml&gt;</pre>
<h3>Where to get the KML parsers?</h3>
Google code provides the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/kml/">APIs for the KML</a>. Also you can find the basic <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/kml/documentation/kml_tut.html">tutorial on KML</a>.
