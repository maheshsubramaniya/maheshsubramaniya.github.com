title: Unmaintainable Code?
categories: ['programming']
---
<p>I came across a peculiar topic named &ldquo;<strong>Unmaintainable Code</strong>&rdquo;&nbsp;<img src="http://www.myhosting.com/blog/smile12.gif" /> on code writing ( programming ). When I read the text, it really sound absurd to me, but view differs. The man who wrote this had a&nbsp;mind and thought different from others.&nbsp;The topic is very interesting and will sound ironic when applied in the software field. When I was looking at the author&rsquo;s name, which sounds familiar for me, surprised me that &ldquo;is he the one who wrote such an article?&rdquo; , who is none other than the man behind the <a href="http://mindprod.com/">mindprod</a>. <img src="http://www.myhosting.com/blog/smile14.gif" /></p>
<p>Read his peculiar article on how not to write a maintainable code or in other words Writing an Unmaintainable code.</p>
