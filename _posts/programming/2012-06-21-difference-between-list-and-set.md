This is a basic question for novice programmer to the experienced. Thought question got very famous with Java Collections, but the concept of List and Set goes way before.

* What is List and Set?
	List and Set are data-structures aimed at storing a series of values which can be accessed sequentially either from head / tail ( mostly from head of the structure).

* When to use List and Set.

	* Use **Set** when you need **unique** values in the collection.

	* Use **List** when you are **not bothered** about uniqueness of the collection
