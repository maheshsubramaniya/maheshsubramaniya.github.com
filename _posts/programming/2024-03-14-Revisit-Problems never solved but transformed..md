title: Revisit-Problems never solved but transformed.
---

Back in 2019, I jotted down a fleeting reflection on a question that may seem trivial at first glance. It's the kind of question that feels almost too obvious, woven as it is into the fabric of our daily existence, which is perhaps why it can feel trivial to contemplate. Yet, take a moment to consider it:

> "Why the problems never cease to exists once solved; Why does it seem as if there's an unending cascade of issues needs our attention?"

Asking these questions lead to inspect *"What events create new problems once it is solved?"*. I am revisiting that thought to see if anything has changed in my perception and try to avoid confirmation bias. This time, I leveraged AI technology to debate that with me.

I asked AI this prompt.

> “Do we solve the problem or transform it to another state?” Debate this statement with me.

AI an I debated for about 15 minutes and  Here is a summary of the debate on the idea that AI and I had.

In a nutshell, this revist has made my thoughts bit wider, yet more stronger on that we always never solve a problem. We won't be able to leave a better world for our next generation. By solving all the manual tasks with Automated (Software and Machines), we transform that issue into another form or shape.
