Do you have a question 'My USB Flash drive is not detected in Leopard'? You face problems after you install or upgraded to new Leopard? Here is a solution for all your problems.

None of the OS is great if it doesn't support USB &amp; Internet. Even Leopard doesn't get a compromise. Most of the people installed Leopard or upgraded to Leopard will face a problem where the USB drives will not be detected. I was tired of searching with Google and finally found a fix for the USB drivers to be detected.You need to install the latest drivers for USB in the leopard machine. Get it from the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/hardwaredrivers/download/usbdebug.html">Apple Developer Connection - USB Debug Kits</a>. You need to get registered in order to download it from the Apple Developer Connection.
