As as computer science graduate, contributing to the computer science field is the most important aspect. But contributing to the field is not a simple task and also, not everyone can do a unique findings, but can try to. I'm doing a small contribution to my field from what I learnt all these days. This blog is one such place to register all my thoughts on the Computer Science and help people who wanted to find resource on computer science concepts and understand few things.
<h4>When did I start?</h4>
My career as programming started as a hobby, when I was introduced to computers at my 7th Class in school. Started with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS">MS-DOS</a>, I started programming as a hobby and then as my career, when I was in my High School ( 12th ). Till date, moving with various positions in software development, I myself view as a passionate programmer. I started a blog as my a just-like-that stuff during my college days, around 2004! It's was on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger_(service)"> Blogger</a> platform and I was not aware of any blog platform. Then came a day where I faced problems to organize my blog contents. <a href="http://maheshexp.wordpress.com">There was a saviour, Wordpress</a>! Then I instantly moved to Wordpress and it's my rocking platform still now.

I used to be very active in lot of forums like <a href="http://www.experts-exchange.com/M_737838.html">Experts-Exchange</a>, but working for a company really makes 'Mahesh a dull boy' !!

Mahesh is interested in stuffs like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number">Prime Numbers</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language">Programming Languages ( C, C++, Java ) </a>, <a href="http://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/">Compilers</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/">Web</a>, <a href="http://www.infoq.com/">Enterprise Softwares</a>, <a href="http://www.ibm.com/soa/">Service Oriented Architecture</a>. I'm not an expert in most of the areas, but pursuing to expand my knowlege in these areas

<span style="font-weight: normal;">During my college days I authored in <a href="http://developeriq.com/">DeveloperIQ</a> magazine, a leading technical magazine in India. Also, wrote few ( very few ;-) ) in the below blogs</span>
