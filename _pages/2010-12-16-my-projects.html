<strong>Mint </strong>- The <strong>M</strong>athematical <strong>Int</strong>erpreter. Impressed a  lot by Matlab and Mathematica, I had a dream of bringing out a small  and simple but a quick mathematical interpreter. I has about 100 inbuilt  functions, which would cover the mathematical basic theories such as  Calculus, Trignometry, Matrices, Functions &amp; Graphs (2D, 3D ),  Algebra.

<strong>jHyperDoc</strong> - A coder formatter for Java, C, C++, VB, Python  programs. Hilights keywords and converts into a HTML file with all the  keywords, braces identified with it. Enables to publish the code online  in the HTML format. This project is created using Java and ANTLR tool.

<strong>dX – dISCOVER &amp; eXplore</strong>, a windows explorer like software  application with all basic feature necessary for a file system viewer.  This software is developed using with Microsoft C#.

<strong>jCalculus</strong> – A symbolic mathematical integral and differential  calculus package written in Prolog and Java. This prolog language is  interfaced with Java through gnu prolog software. All the reduction  rules are written in Prolog.

<strong>TECD</strong> – This is software to automate the process of Tamilnadu  Engineering College Students Admissions. This software is developed with  Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 with Oracle 8 at the backend.

<strong>Quest </strong>– This software is developed to conduct quiz, which  automates the process of quizzing andidation of results etc. This  software is developed using Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 and Microsoft  Access 2000 as the database. This software is developed at <strong>Cognizant Technology Solutions ( CTS ) , Chennai </strong>during my HSC. ( no code available for this )
