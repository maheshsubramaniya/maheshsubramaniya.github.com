<h3>Open Source Software</h3>
<span>Recently I've moved all my works which can be shared into <a title="Github - My Mind Leaks" href="http://github.com/mymindleaks" target="_blank">GitHub</a> with Open Source license. You are free to use them, as long as you give the credit to the original work. Some of the work are done during my college and school days, so it wont have proper formatting code or layout of folders. I will start working on them.</span>

<strong>jLogics</strong> - This is a Digital Circuit simulator tool which had completely written in Java. It can simulate circuits from micro to macro size. It can effectively and efficiently handle Flip flops, Registers, Timers etc.

<strong>Mint </strong>- The <strong>M</strong>athematical <strong>Int</strong>erpreter. Impressed a lot by Matlab and Mathematica, I had a dream of bringing out a small and simple but a quick mathematical interpreter. I has about 100 inbuilt functions, which would cover the mathematical basic theories such as Calculus, Trignometry, Matrices, Functions &amp; Graphs (2D, 3D ), Algebra.

<strong>jHyperDoc</strong> - A coder formatter for Java, C, C++, VB, Python programs. Hilights keywords and converts into a HTML file with all the keywords, braces identified with it. Enables to publish the code online in the HTML format. This project is created using Java and ANTLR tool.

<strong>dX – dISCOVER &amp; eXplore</strong>, a windows explorer like software application with all basic feature necessary for a file system viewer. This software is developed using with Microsoft C#.

<strong>jCalculus</strong> – A symbolic mathematical integral and differential calculus package written in Prolog and Java. This prolog language is interfaced with Java through gnu prolog software. All the reduction rules are written in Prolog.

<strong>TECD</strong> – This is software to automate the process of Tamilnadu Engineering College Students Admissions. This software is developed with Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 with Oracle 8 at the backend.

<strong>Quest </strong>– This software is developed to conduct quiz, which automates the process of quizzing andidation of results etc. This software is developed using Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 and Microsoft Access 2000 as the database.

<h3>Other Web Stuffs</h3>
<a href="http://jminds.hollosite.com">jMinds </a>- One of the site which features stuffs about Java technologies and also helping students for company placements. This was on the free hosting during the college days. Due to inactivity the hosting provider have removed the contents. I've back of them, planning to publish them as a separate hosting or sub-domain in the same URL.

<strong>Import </strong>- A Online portal to conduct Online Programming contests. It would help the users to register ( also in groups ), upload source code and view their points. This software automates the process of compilation and execution. It would check the output of the program code with the expected output.
