Hi, I can very well understand the eagerness to know about ME. First of all
<p align="center"><font color="#999999" size="5">Welcome to my Blog!!!! </font></p>
Do you think O<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>3</sub> = O<sub>5</sub>, then you are a kind of me or to put in other words, I'm your kind. Simple isn't it!!!

Basically, I'm very lazy in writing this, but I'm very eager and interested in typing. Seems to be funny??? Things are easy in typing rather than writing. If you had given me a pen to write this about me section, you should be ready to supply more papers patiently. Wondering how I managed to write my university and school exams, anyway mananged someway.

From my school age, I've got lots of things to express, many things leaks out of my mind. When I try to talk about the things I feel to talk, people started to scream and ran off...Wonder still...I've Just asked them, "Why do they call a SUN as SUN ( sounds SON ), and Who is it's Dad??"..OK ok..Just forget it.

But now, I have a very good media and far more good place to express myself, my thoughts, what I hear, see and Think...I've started my bloging since 2005,Jan, in Blogger. I am one of the admirer of Google and it's services next to Microsoft and Sun Microsystems.

I've finished my Bachelors in Engineering with a Specialization in the Computer Science and Engineering in Anna University. Currently working in Asia's largest software company.

I've been know in the name of <a href="http://www.google.co.in/search?hl=en&amp;q=maheshexp">maheshexp </a>by some the techi friends whom I worked around through Internet. And for all my ILP friends I've been known as Maddy and I'm very proud of moderating one of the big fresher yahoo groups called <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tcs_titans_2005">TCS Titans</a>, which joins almost all the TCS Freshers all over India under one roof.

You can reach me at <a href="mailto:smaheshwaran@gmail.com">smaheshwaran@gmail.com</a> or else contact though the mobile at (+91)9884612037.

I've also written some articles in one of the India's famous magazine DeveloperIQ while I was in college and presented some cool softwares which I was crazy about it in some of the prestigous competetions. I've had a wonderful days during my college life, when I won prize, when submited my projects in competetions such as ICE ( Eclipse ) , Lord of the Code ( RedHat ) , during my Tours &amp; Industrial Visits etc. Those are every green memories of any college guy, that lies always in the gray matter, which is gifted by alma mater to every college student.

Some memorable events which are still been tasted in my mind,

	<li>Freaking out with friends in and around Trivandaram during ILP</li>
	<li>When won first prize in Programming at ILP</li>
