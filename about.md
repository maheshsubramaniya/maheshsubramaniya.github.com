<h2> Welcome</h2>. I'm Mahesh. My today's career has been started as a hobby, when I was introduced to computers during my 7th grade in school. Started to get my hands dirty with [LOGO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language), [BASIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC "BASIC") and [MS-DOS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS) and till now programming with Java, Python, Javascripts etc.,.

My interests started with compilers, web and now solving some complex problems in Enterprises.

Well, to talk about this blog is a place where I register my thoughts and views on Software, Programming and Enterprise software applications. Hope you will find a quite few interesting articles and views of Software, programming & Enterprise Architecture. This blog was basically started during my college days, with a different name. But I decided to go with my name so that it seems bit logical to me. I've migrated this blog on a whole range of blog platforms starting with [Blogger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger_(service)), [Wordpress hosted blog](http://maheshexp.wordpress.com/) now it runs on [Jekyll powered by github](/article/trying-git-hosted-blog-jekyll.html).
