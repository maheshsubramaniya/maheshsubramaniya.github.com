## About

Working with computer engineering is my passion, hobby turned into my career. It all started during my 7th grade in school with [LOGO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language), [BASIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC "BASIC") and [MS-DOS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS) and eventually working to build engineering solutions for some complex business processes.

On side, I get to work on projects that I intent to learn and try to make some useful tools. Probably you can find some interesting projects at https://github.com/msubra
