I'm **<span itemprop="name">Mahesh Subramaniya</span>** (aka. [maheshexp](https://www.google.com/#hl=en&output=search&q=maheshexp&oq=maheshexp) ) around web. My today's career has been started as a hobby, when I was introduced to computers at my 7th Class in school. Started to get my hands dirty with [LOGO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language), [BASIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC "BASIC") and [MS-DOS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS) and till date keep programming with [Java](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)), [Python](http://docs.python.org/), [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/) etc.,. Working on various positions in software development, I still view myself as a passionate programmer. I started a blog as a just-like-that stuff during my college days, circa. 2003-2004! It's was on [Blogger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger_(service)) platform and I was not aware of any blog platform. Then came a day where I faced problems to organize my blog contents. There was a saviour, Wordpress! Then I instantly moved to [Wordpress hosted blog](http://maheshexp.wordpress.com/) and after few years tried to get used to the tumblr. Till then I was mixing up all my technical articles with non-technical articles. Currently, I'm attempting to split them apart. To keep non-technical in [my tumblr blog](http://ms.www.maheshsubramaniya.com). And for my technical articles I recently moved to [Jekyll powered by github](/article/trying-git-hosted-blog-jekyll.html).

I was very active in forums like [Experts-Exchange](http://www.experts-exchange.com/M_737838.html), but due to other priorities, my activity has been reduced these days. Also, I was exploring the depth of [Prime Numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number), doing fascinating things using [Programming Languages ( VB, C, C++, Java )](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) , [Compilers](http://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/), [Web](http://www.w3.org/). 

Once started to work for enterprise, my interests turned towards [Enterprise Software](http://www.infoq.com/), [Service Oriented Architecture](http://www.ibm.com/soa/) and Distributed Systems. I'm not an expert in most of the areas, but pursuing to expand my knowledge in these areas During my college days I authored in [DeveloperIQ magazine](http://developeriq.com/), a leading technical magazine in India. Also, wrote few ( very few ;-) ) in the below blogs Quick Online Tips, ToThePC.

**My Mind Leaks**, is a place where I register my thoughts and views on Software, Programming and Enterprise software applications. Hope you will find a quite few interesting articles and views of Software, programming & Enterprise Architecture. As as computer science graduate, contributing to the computer science field is the most important aspect. I'm trying to do some small contribution to my field from what I learnt all these days. This blog is one such place to register all my thoughts on the Computer Science and help people who wanted to find resource on computer science concepts and understand things.
